For each phase, we introduce the general background, discuss the technical challenges, and review the latest advances. We finally examine the several representative applications of big data, including enterprise management, Internet of Things, online social networks, medial applications, collective intelligence, and smart grid. These discussions aim to provide a comprehensive overview and big-picture to readers of this exciting area. This survey is concluded with a discussion of open problems and future directions.},

	abstract = {The Workshop on Big Data Benchmarking ({WBDB}2012), held on May 8-9, 2012 in San Jose, {CA}, served as an incubator for several promising approaches to define a big data benchmark standard for industry. Through an open forum for discussions on a number of issues related to big data benchmarking—including definitions of big data terms, benchmark processes and auditing — the attendees were able to extend their own view of big data benchmarking as well as communicate their own ideas, which ultimately led to the formation of small working groups to continue collaborative work in this area. In this paper, we summarize the discussions and outcomes from this first workshop, which was attended by about 60 invitees representing 45 different organizations, including industry and academia. Workshop attendees were selected based on their experience and expertise in the areas of management of big data, database systems, performance benchmarking, and big data applications. There was consensus among participants about both the need and the opportunity for defining benchmarks to capture the end-to-end aspects of big data applications. Following the model of {TPC} benchmarks, it was felt that big data benchmarks should not only include metrics for performance, but also price/performance, along with a sound foundation for fair comparison through audit mechanisms. Additionally, the benchmarks should consider several costs relevant to big data systems including total cost of acquisition, setup cost, and the total cost of ownership, including energy cost. The second Workshop on Big Data Benchmarking will be held in December 2012 in Pune, India, and the third meeting is being planned for July 2013 in Xi’an, China.},

	abstract = {Services like social networks, web analytics, and intelligent e-commerce often need to manage data at a scale too big for a traditional database. As scale and demand increase, so does Complexity. Fortunately, scalability and simplicity are not mutually exclusive- rather than using some trendy technology, a different approach is needed. Big data systems use many machines working in parallel to store and process data, which introduces fundamental challenges unfamiliar to most developers. Big Data shows how to build these systems using an architecture that takes advantage of clustered hardware along with new tools designed specifically to capture and analyze web-scale data. It describes a scalable, easy to understand approach to big data systems that can be built and run by a small team. Following a realistic example, this book guides readers through the theory of big data systems, how to use them in practice, and how to deploy and operate them once they're built. {AUDIENCE} This book requires no previous exposure to large-scale data analysis or {NoSQL} tools. Familiarity with traditional databases is helpful. {ABOUT} {THE} {TECHNOLOGY} To tackle the challenges of Big Data, a new breed of technologies has emerged. Many of which have been grouped under the term "{NoSQL}." In some ways these new technologies can be more complex than traditional databases and in other ways, simpler. Using them effectively requires a fundamentally new set of techniques},

	abstract = {ÐMany distributed systems must be scalable, meaning that they must be economically deployable in a wide range of sizes and configurations. This paper presents a scalability metric based on cost-effectiveness, where the effectiveness is a function of the system's throughput and its quality of service. It is part of a framework which also includes a scaling strategy for introducing changes as a function of a scale factor, and an automated virtual design optimization at each scale factor. This is an adaptation of concepts for scalability measures in parallel computing. Scalability is measured by the range of scale factors that give a satisfactory value of the metric, and good scalability is a joint property of the initial design and the scaling strategy. The results give insight into the scaling capacity of the designs, and into how to improve the design. A rapid simple bound on the metric is also described. The metric is demonstrated in this work by applying it to some well-known idealized systems, and to real prototypes of communications software.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the background and state-of-the-art of big data. We first introduce the general background of big data and review related technologies, such as could computing, Internet of Things, data centers, and Hadoop. We then focus on the four phases of the value chain of big data, i.e., data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analysis. For each phase, we introduce the general background, discuss the technical challenges, and review the latest advances. We finally examine the several representative applications of big data, including enterprise management, Internet of Things, online social networks, medial applications, collective intelligence, and smart grid. These discussions aim to provide a comprehensive overview and big-picture to readers of this exciting area. This survey is concluded with a discussion of open problems and future directions.},
